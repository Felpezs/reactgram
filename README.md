# Getting started ðŸš€
To run this project, you should create a database in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) platform. After creating the database instance, a `.env` file should be created following the syntax in `.env-example`, in the backend folder. 

The backend should run in port 5000, if you change this value, then it should be changed in the frontend too, in the `frontend/src/utils/config.js` file.

After this, you can install the dependencies for both apps with `npm ci`, and run the frontend with `npm run dev` and the backend with `npm run server`.
